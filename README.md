## My approach for solving this challenge

Instead of hardcoding questions and answers into the `html`, I created a `data.js` file which contains all the questions and answers plus unique `id` for each one, then I `looped` through the data using `map` function and rendered `html` for each question, I think this way is much easier to handle and maintain, plus it makes it easier to add new questions to our accordion


### Built With

* [Html](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML)
* [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/documentation)
* [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
