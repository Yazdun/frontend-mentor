<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About this project

![Preview of the repo's main index.html](./images/README/d_preview.png)

Here is my solution to Ping challenge ! for the first time I used a sass folder structure to write more readable and cleaner code. I use the architecture provided [here](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and also you can find this architecture's boilerplate [here](https://github.com/KittyGiraudel/sass-boilerplate)
